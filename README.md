All the repositories part of the MindsersIT project:

## Getting started

```bash
yarn --pure-lockfile
```

As this is a localized application you need to specify the language when you start the project (even in development mode):

```bash
yarn start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/en/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To load different language you have to specify it like `yarn start:fr`. You can then access to the website at `http://localhost:4200/fr/`. Available languages are listed in the `package.json`.

### Production build

A command helps you build the project targetting a production environment.

```bash
yarn build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
